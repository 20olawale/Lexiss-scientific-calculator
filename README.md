# Lexiss Scientific Calculator

The **Lexiss Scientific Calculator** is a Python project built using **Tkinter**, combining functionality, usability, and learning growth. This calculator is the result of my journey improving my Python skills and GUI design, evolving from a simple command-line interface to a fully-featured graphical application. It is designed to handle a variety of mathematical operations, making it both a practical tool and a showcase of Python GUI development.

This calculator includes a wide range of features: basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; geometry calculations for squares, rectangles, triangles, cubes, cylinders, cones, and spheres; quadratic equation solving; and simultaneous equations solving for two or three variables. The calculator uses GUI-based input dialogs to make it interactive and user-friendly. Additional convenience features include a backspace button, a clear button, and a dark mode toggle for a better user experience.

The project started as a **simple CLI calculator** using Python loops and conditional statements. Over time, it gradually evolved into a **GUI-based scientific calculator**, adding new features and refining the interface step by step. Each improvement represents a small win in the learning process, demonstrating that consistent effort and iteration lead to meaningful growth.

I welcome **feedback, suggestions, and ideas** to further improve this project. Whether it is refining the interface, optimizing code, or adding new functionalities, collaboration and constructive input are always appreciated. This project serves as a foundation for future improvements while showcasing my current skills in Python and GUI development.

Screenshots of the calculator and its features will be included in the repository to illustrate the main calculator window, geometry operations, and equation solvers. This is intended to give a clear view of how the calculator works and to highlight the progress in building interactive Python projects.

In summary, the **Lexiss Scientific Calculator** is more than a tool—it reflects a journey of learning, persistence, and growth. It is functional, interactive, and constantly improving. I hope it inspires others to celebrate small wins and embrace continuous learning.
